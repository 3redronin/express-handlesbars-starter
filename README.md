express-with-handlebars-starter
===============================

Starter project for express 3 and handlebars.

app.js servers up static stuff from the public folder.  It's got a static index.html as an example.

friends.html is a basic handlebars template; I've chosen to still use .html for templates, but you can do otherwise if that's to your tastes.  

Feel free to email me, sam@samatkinson.com, if you have any issues with this.
